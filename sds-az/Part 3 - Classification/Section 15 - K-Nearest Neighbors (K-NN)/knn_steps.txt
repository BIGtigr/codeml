# Logistic Regression was a linear classifier but K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN)
# is a non-linear classifier.

# Steps required for K Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) algorithm:

# 1. Choose the number K of the neighbours
#   This number signifies the number of data points we want to consider to
#   check the vicinity from the test data point. In practice, a commonly used
#   value is 5, we may take any odd value.

# 2. Take the K-NN of the new data point according to the Euclidean Distance.
#   In practice we might also use any other distance calculating method like
#   Manhattan Distance etc. but Euclidean Distance is commonly used.

# 3. Among these K neighbours, count the number of data points in each category

# 4. Assign the new data point to the category which had the most data points
#   out of total K points we selected in 1.

# 5. FIN. the model is ready
